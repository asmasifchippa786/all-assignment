    <h2>4.MAKE A STATIC RESPONSIVE WEBSITE</h2>

            <li>A simple marketing landing page for a friend or family member’s business or to display his or her personal work</li><br />
        </ul>

    <h2>5.BUILD A FORM</h2>
    <p>
        Knowing how to put interactive controls together to build a form is extremely useful in web development. You use buttons, inputs, forms, and HTML elements to allow for user input. This is also a chance to show your UX and UI skills by making the form accessible, making decisions about placeholder helper text, and creating labels for form fields.
