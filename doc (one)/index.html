    <h1>What can I build with HTML and CSS?</h1>
    <p>
        HTML and CSS are the foundation of websites in that they provide structure and atyling to a web page.
        With HTML, you can add non-interactive element Such as text and images, and include interactive
        element such as links, buttons, and videos.<br /><br />
        With CSS, you can style web pages. You can also make websites reponsive using CSS. This ia possible
        with media queries, which were introduced in CSS3.<br /><br />
        (HTML is on its fifth iteration, so you'll see it referred to as HTML5, why CSS is on its third-aka
        CSS3.)<br /><br />
         Since the addition of media queries, it's possible to check the width and hight of the current device, as
        well as the orientation (landscape or portait). That means you can make a site mobile responsive using
        just HTML and CSS.<br /><br />
        It's possible to create animations using CSS by gradually Changing an element's properties. And you can
        even create flashy scrolling effects (Known as "<a href="https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/">Parallax</a>")with CSS.<br /><br />
        While working on HTML and CSS projects can help you build beautiful websites, for more complex
        sites, you would most likely want to use JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can fetch data from a database,
        handle different states of an application, and easily add interactive elements like a slider.<br /><br />
        That said, there’s still a LOT you can do with HTML and CSS alone. Let’s take a look at some great
        project ideas to try out.<br /><br />
