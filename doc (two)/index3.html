    A Questionnaire<br /><br />
    Forms are often included on websites as part of their strategy for collecting client data. A well-designed
survey form may assist you in obtaining valuable information about your target consumers, such as
their age, work, location, taste and preference, and pain areas, all of which can be useful for your
business. You may use this HTML project to test your abilities and knowledge to develop forms and
organize a web page.<br /><br />

You can create a technical documentation page if you have a working grasp of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. The underlying concept of this project is to develop a technical documentation page where
you can click on any subject on the page, and it will load the relevant material on the page. The project
is a plain and easy technical documentation website; nothing particularly exciting about it. You must
split the website into two sections to complete this HTML homework. You can use back end and fetch
data from DB and make it full fledge project<br /><br />
