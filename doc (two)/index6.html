        Working knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 is required to construct a personal portfolio page on your
website. Your web page will include the normal information found in a job portfolio, such as your name
and picture, projects, special talents, and hobbies. You will complete this project to get credit for it.
Additionally, you may include your CV and store the whole portfolio on GitHub using your GitHub
account. GitHub accounts are free to use. You may provide a brief description of your professional
career and hobbies at the top of the page, along with your picture, in the header section. You might
provide a few examples of your work below this description. Finally, you may provide links to your
social network profiles in the footer area.<br /><br />
