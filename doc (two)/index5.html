A Website with a Parallax Effect<br /><br />
<img width="480" height="250" src="./imge/o.png" alt=""><br /><br />
Rather than having moving graphics in the background, a parallax website has fixed images in the
backdrop that you may stay in place while scrolling down the page to view various areas of the image.
A newbie well-versed in HTML ideas may create a parallax website in a single day! An essential
parallax website has a fixed picture in the backdrop and enables you to scroll up and down the page to
view the various elements of that image from different perspectives. Divide the whole page into three to
four separate pieces and see how it works for you. Create a parallax effect by using three or four
background pictures, aligning the text for separate parts, adjusting margins and padding, and using
background-position and other CSS elements and attributes.<br /><br />
